<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Ten years ago, I left my family home in San Bernardino to finish my undergrad in San Francisco. I made life-long friends with roommates who all moved away after the 2 year program.
During college, I helped form a band and played bassist for four wild years. We gigged, we toured, and recorded. We had an unforgettable time! I haven't seen much of anyone since 2020.

I live in Emeryville with my partner David. We met while working a summer job at FitBit. In most ways we are complete opposites, 
and over time we have enriched each other's lives, perspectives, and abilities. We can't change everything though. He is still a night owl, 
and I still prefer music over TV. We like to travel, go to concerts, and spend time with our families. In the past 2 years we've visited Mexico, UK, Austria, Budapest, Germany, Thailand, and Japan. 
This fall, we'll travel to El Salvador with my parents, and next year I'd like to see the Northern Lights. There's no major summer trip planned for 2024, but we have racked up on some concerts!
The highlights include Incubus, Mana, and soon we'll see Billie Eilish with my niece! On the bucket list is The Red Hot Chilli Peppers and The Killers, who I'd love to see with my siblings.

  That's me in a nutshell! I left out all of the bouts of anxiety that came with leaving everything I knew. Luckily, all the right people found me, and I continue to create meaningful connections, though a bit more slowly than before. 
  The loneliness of the pandemic cleared the fog on internal struggles with identity, so I invested in a personal coach. I've since adopted a practice of mental wellness; setting boundaries, observing and regulating my 
  nervous system, and welcoming joy. I swim twice a week, I do a hair oil treatment every Saturday, and I practice coding at work and at home. The act of making inches of progress paired with things I enjoy doing, is defining what it means to 
  be well for me. Of course, I miss my family and nothing can replace that. I will find my way back when the time is right. For now, it is best that I continue to build on my strengths and befriend my fears. Onward, my friends! Let's trust the process.
